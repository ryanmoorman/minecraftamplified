Ryan's Latest Minecraft Map
------------------

*Creative Mode*

This map is based on an aplified seed and has most of the buildings up in the mountains. Make sure to check out some of these cool things:

*The Grand Budapest Hotel
*Insanely large hospital complex (for no reason, have fun trying to navigate it)
*Nearly 1000 pink sheep
*More to come

**This is intended to provide an illustration of the work that I do in Minecraft, I am not accepting contributions to this save, but I will field siggestions.**
