Ryan's Latest Minecraft Map
------------------

*Creative Mode*

This map is based on an aplified seed (which is not typically used for building). This map is ridiculously large for something made offline by one person, so if you wish to navigate all of it, follow the existing railway paths. Make sure to check out some of these cool things:

*Extensive railway system

*The Grand Budapest Hotel mockup

*large, vacant buildings everywhere

*Nearly 1000 pink sheep in a glass dome

*underwater railways

*beacon color changing machines/redstone computer programs for operation

*tasteful design experimentations

**This is intended to provide an illustration of the work that I do in Minecraft, I am not accepting contributions to this save, but I will field suggestions.**
